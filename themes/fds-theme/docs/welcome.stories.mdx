Welcome to the home for next generation implementation of our design system.
It includes a theme built over custom properties and a web components' implementation of our UI kit.
We are still in beta so expect regular changes in components' structure and parameters.

## Get started

#### Foundations

Foundations are a set of variables and tools written in SASS.
It's part of `@finastra/fds-theme` library and help you:

- make consistent UI quickly
- adopt Finastra's branding
- ensure accessibility
- deal with browser compatibility
- handle theming

#### Components

Components are the pieces of UI that you assemble to create patterns and screens. For maximum compatibility with web standards and front-end frameworks, the implementation of those components is provided as web-components.

#### Patterns

Patterns are larger concepts that are recurring in financial app creation. They heavily rely on components and solve various UX needs.

## Contribute

Our design system libraries are open-source. Contributions are highly encouraged. Please read our [contribution process on GitHub](https://github.com/Finastra/finastra-design-system/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
