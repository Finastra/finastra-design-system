# FDS Theme Elevation

<Meta title="Foundations/Elevation" />

We use 24 levels of elevation. From 0 which means there is no elevation to 24 which is the highest level of elevation.

## Mixins

```SCSS
@use '@finastra/fds-theme' as fds;

.my-elevated-component {
  @include fds.elevation(4);
}
```

## Helper classes

Before being able to use the helper classes, you need to include them in your Sass styles.

```SCSS
@use '@finastra/fds-theme/helpers';
```

Then you'll be able to use helper classes in your app's HTML

```HTML
<div class="fds-elevation-2">
   <p>some content</p>
</div>
```
