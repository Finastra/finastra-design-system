  <p>Finastra* (“we”, “us” or “Finastra”) is a leading provider of financial services software  that the world's financial institutions rely on every day to help them grow and succeed. Our customers, consumers, prospects, registered users, applicants for employment, and others with whom we do business entrust us with their personal data and personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and they expect us to protect that Personal Information with the same level of care we do our own. This is fundamental to the way we do business.</p>

<p>This Finastra Privacy Policy External (the “Policy”) describes the practices we have adopted with respect to processing Personal Information including the collection, use, storage or disclosure of Personal Information, (i) on our websites that link to this Policy (collectively the “Sites”); (ii) when you interact with our support centre or other online forums; (ii) when you participate in our webinars, events and demonstrations; (iii) when you purchase our products or services (“Services”); or (iv) when you interact with us as a vendor, partner or sub-contractor, except where there are specific privacy requirements for a Service and a separate policy has been published for that particular Service.</p>

<h3>SCOPE</h3>

<p>Whether acting as a data controller, a data processor or data intermediary, Finastra is required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations protecting the privacy of Personal Information in the jurisdictions where Finastra conducts business.</p>

<p>We may amend this Policy from time to time, should it become necessary or advisable to do so to comply with regulatory requirements or best practices. The most recent modification date of this Policy will appear at the top of this page. If we materially change our practices in processing Personal Information, we will post an updated policy in place of this Policy.</p>

<h3>GENERAL DEFINITIONS</h3>

<p>These definitions may vary slightly according to local data privacy laws.</p>

<p>“Personal Information” is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (which in some jurisdictions may include individuals who are recently deceased, and whether or not the information is true) or to a legal entity (to the extent protected under applicable data protection law), recorded in any medium including but not limited to electronic, paper, or voice recordings. It may include information such as name, address, date of birth, identification numbers, financial information and any other identifiable personal information. Personal Information may include non-identifiable information which, when combined with other information to which Finastra is likely to have access, can be used to identify an individual.</p>

<p>Individuals or entities that are identified or identifiable by Personal Information are referred to as “data subjects”.</p>
