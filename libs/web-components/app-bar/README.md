# AppBar
The app bar contains essential items related to your application. It is used for branding with the logo, title with the app name, navigation and actions.

Menu, navigation, content and actions are slots where you can put customized content based on what your application requires.

We recommend to use global navigation [templates](https://finastra.github.io/finastra-design-system/?path=/story/patterns-global-nav--default) if you need examples.

## Demo
