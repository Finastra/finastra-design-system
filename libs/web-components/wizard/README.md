A wizard is a setup process where the user is guided through a series of steps to achieve a goal. The purpose of the pattern is to simplify tasks by cutting them into smaller ones.It is easy to navigate between the steps which helps the user to complete lengthy forms in less time. Also the user can save it and revisit the wizard when he/she has the relevant required information available.
