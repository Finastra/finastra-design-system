## <a name="questions"></a> Asking Questions
At the moment we only have a Microsoft Teams' channel dedicated to questions. If you're not part of the organization, you can still send your questions by mail to [UXG - Questions](206630c8.finastra.com@emea.teams.ms).

## <a name="issues"></a> Issues and Bugs
If you discover a bug along your way, you can help by filling a Github issue.
Before submitting it, please consider the following steps:

- Check you are using the latest version
- Make sure the bug is not already covered in the list of open issues
- Reproduce the issue in a live editor like [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) or [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
- Take screenshots if it's a UI issue
- Provide the informations requested in the [bug report template](https://github.com/fusionfabric/finastra-design-system/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

Then the process of reviewing, planning and hopefully fixing your issue will start.
